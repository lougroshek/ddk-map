The Index reveals vast inequities in how neighborhood opportunity is distributed across the U.S. You can use the information in the Index to understand what neighborhood opportunity patterns look like in your community: where do children experience all the conditions they need to thrive (high and very high-opportunity neighborhoods) and where do children lack access to neighborhood opportunity (very low and low-opportunity neighborhoods)?</p><p>You can use this data to start conversations about equity in your community, identify neighborhoods in your community that would benefit from targeted investment, propose changes to policies that shape where resources like parks and playgrounds are allocated, work to change exclusionary zoning and many other actions that can increase equity and ensure that all children are able to grow and thrive to their full potential.</p>',

Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features and their primary purpose is to provide a stable geography for the presentation of data over a long window of time so that statistical comparisons can be made from one decennial census to the next. These qualities make census tracts closely mirror real neighborhoods, which, in turn, makes them a useful geography for understanding inequity. Neighborhoods reflect the everyday experiences of individuals, including their access to opportunity. Although some people might travel long distances in the pursuit of opportunity, in our day to day lives we often only have access to the opportunities and resources that are in our neighborhoods or close to where we live.</p>',
